## Description: 

This Application was created as a group project by Team: No Nonsense Technical Difficulties. The valued team members are: Owen Dupree, Kayla Dombrosky, Shaeon Adams, Carlin Shaw, and Austin Swebilius. This application was made with the Google Distance Matrix API, Google Places API, and Google Static Map API. The CSS was completed using Materialize, and Jquery. Owen, Kayla, and Carlin worked together to complete the JavaScript coding. Shaeon worked on the Index file along with Kayla. The README, and Github Repo creation with initial files was done by Austin. All team members worked to contribute through research and troubleshooting while two or three wrote code. 

The purpose of our application is to give User's the ability select either their location pr input an address then select their method of travel and the distance they want to travel. The map will then update to center on their location while also displaying the randomly selected location based on the parameters entered by the User. Both the User's location and their destination will be marked on the map. Drive time, distance, and the status, whether or not the location is open, will be displayed to give the User the information they need. Future development of this application will include a "Surprise Me" feature that instead of displaying the map and the markers will only give written directions so the User can enjoy a surprise random location. Additional location types will also be added as part of future development plans.

This project taught our group how to work together, research, and effectively implement APIs. It taught us how to use the AGILE project methodology and how to be flexibile when faced with obstacles. It gave us a better understanding of working in a team environment and how to assign tasks suited to the team member's individual skills. This project taught us to combine both JavaScript and jQuery to achieve the desired results. We have learned how to effectively apply the past modules to develop this project and gained necessary hands-on experience.
